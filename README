czmorphology is a shared library to lemmatize/analyze words. It is a refactored
code of Jan Hajic's binary and requires original data files from the binary
distribution: *{ae.cpd,au.cpd,ag.txt,aw.cpd}, which is available e.g. in the
PDT 2.0 (http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/pdt2.0/). The output is equivalent to the
output of the original binary distribution.

The interface is quite simple:

Main benefits compared to the original code:

- shared library code
- 64-bit compatible
- no memory leaks
- faster initialization
- UTF-8 input/output
- thread safety (only one thread can lemmatize a word at tha same time, though)
- output compatible with

In order to compile/use it, configure; make; make install should be sufficient.
